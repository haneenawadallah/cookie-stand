        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <img src="images/family.jpg" alt="Salmon shirt"> 
        <p>The company was founded by Pat, a military couple with a passion for baking and service.

            When Pat was deployed overseas, Angie made over 20 care packages and these weren’t your ordinary care packages. 
            Each came with a separate theme in an oversized bankers box. They were stuffed full of goodies, treats, and of course – 
            her homemade cookies.
            
            Now that passion has become a business that gives back. They regularly send batches of cookies to active service members on deployment,
             as well as support the Wounded Warrior Project. </p>
